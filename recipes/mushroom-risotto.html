    <p><strong>Total time:</strong> 45 mins <b>|</b> Easy <b>|</b> serves 4</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pack (300 g) white mushroom</li>
        <li>1 brown onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>300 g risotto rice</li>
        <li>1 tin (400 g) cream of mushroom soup</li>
        <li>1 vegetable stock pot</li>
        <li>2 tbsp parsley, finely chopped</li>
        <li>75 g medium cheddar, finely grated</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil (1 tbsp) in a large saucepan and cook the mushrooms (1 pack) over a high heat for 4-5 minutes until golden. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat down to medium-low, add the onion (1) and cook for 8-10 minutes, until soft but not coloured. Season, add the garlic (2 cloves) and cook for another minute, stirring.</li>
        <li>Stir in the rice (300 g) and cook for 1 minute until coated. Add the soup (1 tin) and bring to a gentle bubble before cooking, stirring frequently for 3-4 minutes, until a spoon leaves a trail on the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Measure out 1 litre of just-boiled water in a jug and add the stock pot (1) to dissolve. Use a little to swirl out the soup can, then pour the stock into the rice little by little, stirring between each addition, until the rice is creamy but still with a little bite. This will take about 20-25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the mushrooms and most of the cheese (75 g) and parsley (2 tbsp), cooking for 1 minute until the cheese has melted.</li>
        <li>To serve, scatter with the remaining parsley and cheese.</li>
    </ol>
